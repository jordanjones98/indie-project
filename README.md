## Problem Statement

I run a remote controll car/truck offroad race track in Burlington, Wisconsin.
We frequently hold races that are open to the public. Most of the time people either show up late, or forget
to sign up before the races start. This causes confusion on our end, and the customers.
Also, it can be kind of a pain to sign up when you are trying to get ready.
I am going to build an app to manage the race entries, and track driver analytics.
I may also implement a payment option through some third party application such as
PayPal, or Stripe. I am also hoping I can use a machine learning API to trend how
many people will come for a certain day based on time of year, tempeture, day of the week etc.
